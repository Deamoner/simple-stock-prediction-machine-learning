# Simple stock mediction machine learning

This repo has the jupyter notebook/colab of a simple implementation of linear regression model as the machine learning for stock prediction as well as going through a review of it's accuracy and how to use it.

## Installation

I suggest just importing the notebook files into good colab.

## Next Steps

As a next step we will expand this into using more advanced techniques and see how those improve it as well as reviewing what variables/features might be best to include in machine learning prediction.
